# Comparison of methods to identify important SNPs in Arabidopsis thaliana: following the methods of Puthiyedth et al., 2025

This project adapted code from the paper "Leveraging LASSO-based methodologies for enhanced SNP analysis in plant genomes" by Puthiyedth et al., 2025. This paper compared two methods for identifiying SNPs, Biglasso and PLINK.

This project was completed as part of the Topics in Bioinformatics course at the University of Guelph's Masters of Bioinformatics program.
